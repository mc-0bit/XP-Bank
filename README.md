# XP Bank
Allows you to store XP while at level 100 and withdraw it later on when you're below level 100.

This mod aims to be a drop in replacement for [XP Bank](https://modworkshop.net/mod/31975 "XP Bank") with a ingame option to adjust the XP multiplier yourself in case you dont want to be stuck at a set value.

You can freely switch between both versions since this mod uses the same savefile.

Make sure you only have one of them in your mods folder as they will cause conflicts.

This mod tries to implement all updates that the original version recieves.

# Mod information
Tired of grinding Infamy levels and playing the same maps over and over?

Maybe you've given up on grinding altogether, coming to terms with the fact that there's too many Infamy levels in Payday 2.

If so, this mod is for you.

How It Works ðŸ‘€

* While you're level 100, the XP you earn from completing heists is saved
* Whenever you decide to go Infamous, you can withdraw that XP to skip levels

Now you can enjoy Payday 2 at its fullest without going through the tedious grind!

**Instructions**
1. Go to Options
2. Go to Mod Keybinds
3. Set a Keybind for XP Bank
4. (optional)
     1. Go to Options
     2. Go to Mod Options
     3. Go to XP Bank
     4. Set the desired XP multiplier (default is 0.7)
5. When you're level 100, a message in chat will display after completing a heist (example)
6. When you're below level 100, you can withdraw the XP you've saved.

*NOTE: After withdrawing XP, be sure to go to your Inventory afterwards for the changes to reflect, then back out to the main menu for the changes to save!*
